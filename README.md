Written by Logan Wille in collaboration with Donglian Xu from 2018.

This project is the classification algorithm part of Logan Wille's thesis project. This algorithm uses a proprietary library called IceTray and data structure from the IceCube collaboration (https://icecube.wisc.edu/). Additionally, this algorithm uses reconstruction methods created by members of the IceCube collaboration, these are not included here.

For a detailed discussion of the classification algorithm along with plots verifing its performance, please see chapter 5 of my dissertation (https://icecube.wisc.edu/~lwille/LoganDissertation.pdf). For a briefer overview of the analysis, please see my recent proceedings from the Internation Cosmic Ray Conference (https://icecube.wisc.edu/~lwille/Astrophysical_Tau_Neutrino_Identification_withIceCube_Waveforms.pdf).
